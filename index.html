<p>Having had the opportunity to earn my living as a software developer
since 1997, I have lost count of the number of meetups and conferences
I’ve attended as a participant or speaker, the number of YouTube videos
I’ve watched, blog posts I’ve read and written – all in pursuit of one
goal: improving my skills as a developer and to become a god of the
world wide web, a ninja, a rock star, a full stack developer.</p>
<p>Many developers see themselves as artists and their works as divine
creations brought into existence by heroic acts of willpower that are
only possible after many, many years – by day as a paid software
professional, and by night as an open source contributor.</p>

<h2>Stop becoming a full stack developer</h2>
<p>your efforts are futile</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>It was in 2012 when I started to interact with the community outside
of my workplace and then eventually realized that the effort to become a
full stack developer is futile.</p>
<p>Five years later, after having met many amazing, humble people in the
<a href="https://www.softwarecrafters.org/">software craft community</a>
that care about software quality the same way I do, <a
href="https://coderbyheart.com/the-full-stack-developer-trap">I
concluded</a> that the aim to become a master on all levels of the stack
stems from a preposterous self-glorification. Building world class
software is  a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework">complex and
sometimes chaotic</a> process that requires knowledge on so many
different aspects (backend, frontend, UX, privacy, accessibility, CI/CD,
operations, etc.) that it’s impossible for an individual to acquire the
amount of knowledge needed to be <em>the</em> expert on all of them.</p>

</figure>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Being a full stack developer supposedly means that you possess the
skills to develop an application end to end. This is of course a very
simplified view, since being a full stack developer means you need to be
proficient in a multitude of areas: your skill is not a single value but
varies across the professions as shown in this graph.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: what is your overall level? Your highest skill in
one of these areas (so a t-shaped skill set lets you call yourself a
full stack developer), your lowest skill (you need to master all in
order to call yourself one), or an average?</p>

<p>You can see that the label of ‘full stack developer’ <a

problematic already</a>.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>If we consider more deeply what is needed to develop software, we
also need to take into account the various requirements of the
respective domain the application is intended for.</p>
<p>Your skill is always relative to the sector you are working in. If
you mostly work on ecommerce projects, you will most likely have deep
knowledge in performance, payment systems, and user journeys. If you
work on internal banking systems, your fields of expertise will have an
entirely different focus.</p>

<p>All of the above also needs to be viewed through an important fourth
dimension: time!</p>
<p>Your skill is a function of the time you spend improving it, and
since you cannot simultaneously improve all skills at the same time,
your absolute full stack developer skill will fluctuate over the years
of your career.</p>

<p>Software is an incredibly fast-changing field, and the skills
associated with a full stack developer usually become outdated within a

<p>This realization brought me to the conclusion of focusing my learning
journey on the area where my talent, my interests, and my ability to
sell these skills <a

<aside class="notes">
<p>I didn’t see it in 2017, and it seems like I was still framing my
function in isolation. To you it might be obvious: building software is
a team effort and typical project sizes make it impossible to be the
sole decision-maker for all technical decisions in a project.</p>
<p>It took me a while to realize this. I am most likely not the only
developer going through this process. It’s impossible to achieve
greatness solely on your own.</p>

<h2>We want people to be like our code</h2>
<p><em>Just</em> explain, really slowly, what’s wrong with

<aside class="notes">
<p>Somehow, as engineers, we expect people to have the same quality: to
fix a problem, I just have to explain, really slowly, what’s wrong with
them for the problem to go away.</p>
<p>However, in the past I’ve invested very little time in educating
myself on collaboration and communication. And I am certainly not
alone.</p>
<p>We developers happily pay (with our money and our time) for getting
up to speed on tech topics. We don’t do this for communication and
collaboration skills. And this is not because our employers don’t offer
this, as they rarely offer structured tech training, either.</p>
<p>I want us to change this. That’s why I am writing this article.</p>

<h2>I’d love to have more software problems</h2>

<aside class="notes">
<p>If I would categorize the problems I encountered in my career into
people problems and software problems, it’s only the people problems
that are the real challenge.</p>
<p>I’d love to have more software problems, because dealing with
software problems is sometimes hard, but there is always a solution: fix
it, hack it, or scrap it and take another approach.</p>
<p>But people problems are the ones that give me sleepless nights and
stress me out. These problems are different: we can’t make the person on
the other side do what we want – we can only try to get on the same
level with them to resolve issues, but we can’t, ultimately, change
them.</p>

<p>Our industry is flooded with communities, blog posts, meetups, and
conferences that revolve around technical skills.</p>
<p>Over time, I have developed a great sense for finding interesting
content through Twitter, Slack, and  YouTube because I know what to look
for and my trained pattern recognition skill can easily identify
relevant tech content. But when it comes to collaboration,
communication, and leadership, I don’t have that sixth sense, yet. Let’s
look at the actions I’ve taken in the past couple of years to start
developing it.</p>

<h2>Communication frameworks</h2>
<p>Algorithms for human interaction.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I mentioned earlier that people problems are different to software
problems, which means we cannot apply the same principles. I can’t fix
another person, however, <a href="http://threeminutetherapy.com/rebt">I
am responsible for how their actions affect me</a>. I decide to feel
angry, hurt, annoyed, ashamed. How I feel about something is solely my
responsibility.</p>
<p>There are communication frameworks we  can adopt or extend on like we
do for software. Because, as with software frameworks, communication
frameworks should prevent us from making the same mistakes over and over
again and provide best practices that will let us achieve our goals
faster: less conflict when communicating with others.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent
communication</a> helps to identify my emotions and separate them from
the message, it also gives you the tools to help the other party help
you, by providing clear information about how you feel (without blaming
them), and providing them ways to help you. It gives you a process to
dissect communication and try to find the true message, which might be
wrapped in emotions and hard to understand initially. But this is a
one-sided method, where I do the analysis and do not work with the other
person on the way they communicate.</p>
<p>Lara Hogan has a talk on how to use this method for feedback on

<aside class="notes">
<p>The <a

model</a> is a valuable complement to non-violent communication, since
it also models a message as a composite of various aspects and it helps
to identify and separate the different aspects that were amalgamated by
the sender of a message. I learned about this model back when I was
studying communication as part of my first professional education many
years ago. It’s helpful to identify the aspects within the model in
written communication in order to better understand the true meaning of
a message.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Since most people work for some kind of affirmation, the <a

languages</a> give a good model about the different ways humans are
receptive of gratification and it is important, as a collaborator, to
understand what drives them and how you can give them the feeling that
you value their work. The important learning here is that means of
affirmation can be completely different to your own, so you need to make
a conscious effort to translate affirmation and gratitude in a way the
recipient understands.</p>

<h2>The core protocols</h2>

<aside class="notes">
<p>A few years ago I took the time to read <a
href="https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/">The Core
Protocols</a>, but they are very regimented approaches to human
interaction. This works for some, but in my experience, requires a lot
of discipline. Many that experience using it, develop an uncanny valley
feeling of being overly controlled. In my experience as an
organizational coach, these systems do not work well with heterogeneous
teams where you gradually change something; it’s hard to explain to an
‘outsider’ why this makes sense and it can actually feel inhuman. It is,
however, a fascinating source material to look into because it very
explicitly highlights communication issues and how to deal with
them.</p>

<p>L. David Marquet’s ‘<a

Leadership</a>’ is a really powerful concept that describes ‘angles of
freedom’ in a collaborative relationship. What’s great about it is that
it provides a model for communication that involves everybody in making
implicit rules around decision-making explicit, and provides a road
towards enabling team members to make autonomous decisions.</p>
